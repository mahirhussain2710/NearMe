    Colachel is a hidden gem with a pristine beach and untouched beauty. It has played a major role in defending Tamil Nadu from Dutch invasions, and was once part of the Travancore kingdom. In 1741, the Travancore King Marthanda Varma defeated the Dutch East India Company, and a victory pillar was erected on the beach to commemorate the victory. This ancient pillar, known as the Colachel Pillar, is visited by history lovers every year.
